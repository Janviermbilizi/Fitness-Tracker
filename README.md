# Fitness-Tracker

<strong>Name</strong>

This project takes the name of (Fitness-Tracker) as it is a workout app.

<strong>Description </strong>

As a web developer, I want a deployed portfolio so that I can showcase my applications to potential employers and clients. It is in that spirit that my instructor gave me and other students a homework to design a fitness-tracker app. With this app, the user will be able to view create and track daily workouts, to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day, to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user will be able to track distance traveled.

<strong>Programs used</strong>

I used HTML, CSS (in Video Studio Code) and Bootstrap, javascript, jquery, node, express mongodb, Git/Github and heroku.

<strong>Installation </strong>

This is only website and does not need installation. it is currently hosted in heroku and you can access it at https://fitness-traker.herokuapp.com/

<strong>Usage</strong>

The page is simple, clean, easy to use and undertand. The welcome page provide you the last workout info, the botton to continue working out and to add a new workout. The dashboard above provide you you overall workout and exercises you have done in form of a chart.
